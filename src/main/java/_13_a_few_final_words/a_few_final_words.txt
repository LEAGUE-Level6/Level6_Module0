A few final words on unit testing:


As with other parts of programming, there are different opinions regarding style.  Throughout these unit test classes,
two different naming conventions for methods were used:

itShould___

given_when_then (A.K.A the Behavior Driven Design naming convention)

One thing is universally agreed upon regarding this topic: the name of the test method should tell us a complete story of
what piece of functionality it covers.  Throughout the previous test classes, the itShould___ was typically used when
the test covered the entire method, and when it covered the happy path.  However the BDD naming convention is much more
descriptive when it comes to naming tests that cover certain branches within a method
e.g: givenNoDrivers_whenDeliver_thenThrowException()


If you have a new found love for unit testing, there are a couple other topics you may want to look into that were not
within the scope of this module:
-Mockito @Spy annotation
    -It is the same idea as a mock, except it simply wraps an actual instance of the class.  All the stubbing and ability
    to track interactions is the same as a mock, but unlike a mock, all the original functionality of the class remains
    usable.

-Mockito ArgumentCaptor
    -A totally new feature that allows us to capture arguments that are passed into a method invoked within our test
    method, in order for us to inspect them.
    Imagine you passed some parameters into the method you are testing. Somewhere within the method those parameters
    are used to create an object which is, in turn, used as a parameter to call a method.  By using an ArgumentCaptor,
    you can capture that parameter and verify that it contains the values you are expecting it to contain.

-Additional possible uses of the Mockito verify() method that were not discussed.
